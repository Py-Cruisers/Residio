## Pitch  

### Residio  

> What problem or pain point does it solve?  

This web application enhances the first impression. We solve the pain point of having the same resume as everyone else by supplementing the traditional resume with video.

> What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?  

The Minimum Viable Product: Our MVP is to create a web application where a user can upload a resume with the ability to add a video to the resume to explain your accomplishments and add a personal touch/introduction. Also, users will be able to revisit and/or share their resume and video introduction via the link to their page.
